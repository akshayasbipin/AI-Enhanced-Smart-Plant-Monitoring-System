# Smart Plant Monitoring System

## Overview

The Smart Plant Monitoring System is an IoT-based project designed to monitor and maintain optimal conditions for plant growth. It uses temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and PIR sensors to track environmental factors and detects animal movement. A water pump button is included for irrigation control.

## Features

* Monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
* Detects animal movement using a PIR sensor.
* Manual water pump activation via a button.
* Real-time data monitoring using NodeMCU.

## Components Used

* NodeMCU (ESP8266)
* Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11)
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* PIR Motion Sensor
* Water Pump with Button
* Connecting Wires and Breadboard

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/akshayasbipin/PlantCareBot.git]
   ```
2. Upload the Arduino code to the NodeMCU.
3. Connect the sensors and the water pump as per the circuit diagram.
4. Monitor data in real-time through the connected device.
